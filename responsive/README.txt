The goal of this lab is to practice reading HTML, writing CSS, and utilizing responsive design to make use of sprite sheets. I believe this work has been implemented correctly according to the homework guidelines. 

I did not collaborate with anyone. 

I spent approximately 1.5 hours to complete the assignment.
