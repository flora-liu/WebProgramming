The goal of this lab is to practice using the following:
- Javascript objects
- Document Object Model (DOM)
- event handling
- first-class functions

I believe this work has been implemented correctly according to the homework guidelines. 

I collaborated with Bill Yung and Marcus Mok.

I spent approximately 1.5 hours to complete the assignment.
