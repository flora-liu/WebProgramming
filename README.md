#COMP 20 Web Programming Portfolio

#####Purpose
This repository contains all the work and learning I have done for my Web Programming class at Tufts. These projects and the corresponding technologies used include:
- captainslog: jQuery
- landmarks: Google Maps API
- messages: HTTP GET request
- my_old_kentucky_home: Javascript
- responsive: Responseive design
- security: Security analysis

#####Favorite Assignment
My favorite assignment was the landmarks project. I especially enjoyed this project because I was able to create a project that was interactive (take a user's location information and populate it on a map). I also liked learning how to use the Google Maps API, because I am now comfortable with exploring/ using other APIs for future projects.

#####Growth
From day 1 of the course to now, my web programming knowledge has grown significantly. Through developing content on the web for various platforms, I was introduced to different basic techniques and technologies that place me at a great starting point for future web projects. Most importantly, I have developed a huge interest in web programmming and hope to continue learning more about web development.

#####Most Important Things About COMP 20
Two major takeaways from this course are:
1. Self-learning: For all the assignments in this class, I had to learn how to find answers on my own- from talking to others to researching on the Internet. Knowing where to access useful information and being resourceful is a skill that was really emphasized in this course.
2. Security: It is important to know how to build things, but knowing how to protect them should also be prioritized. The security assignment enabled me to realize how vulnerable most websites are- which is why we should also focus on security in web development.


#####Future
After finishing this course, I hope to take Web Engineering and Security classes to further my knowledge on web programming.
